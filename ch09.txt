**How do you get that 4% figure?**

Hare's classic estimate is 1%. He focuses on criminal male psychopaths. So I double to account for female psychopaths. I double it again to allow for the many psychopaths who stay hidden all their lives. In fact, predator-prey ratios are not constant. They cycle over time. So it could be between less than 1% and 10% depending on context. If there are cycles, they take at least several generations.

**Is there a single accurate psychopath test?**

Yes. It is neither quick nor simple. I can explain a few different ways that often work.

First, how a person deals with rules. You observe the person for some time, weeks or months. When they break a rule or social code (and everyone does), you watch their behavior. You look for guilt before someone catches them. You look for shame and remorse after someone catches them. If they show none of these, they may be a psychopath. If they show all these, they most likely are not. To be sure you must catch several instances of rule breaking, in different contexts. If the psychopath knows you're watching, it may not work.

Second, by your own responses and behavior. This works if you are seeing the person often and getting into some form of relationship with them. It feels better than normal. You feel swept off your feet. You are doing favors for this person. They have rapid mood changes, usually to anger for some minor reason. You find yourself apologizing. You find yourself changing your plans to suit them.

Third, using white flagging. Start by assuming //everyone// you meet is a psychopath. Don't panic. It's not a decision, just a possibility. Then you look for signs to disprove this possibility. Old friends who speak well of them. A clear public history. Zones of happiness around them. Modesty and shyness. Blushing, a sense of humor, creative zest. And so on. As long as you cannot disprove the theory "X is a psychopath," 
leave them in that category and treat them with care.

**Is it normal that I'm looking for psychopaths everywhere now?**

This is a common experience. I call it Van Helsing Syndrome. The awareness that the world is full of people who see you as food is disturbing. My advice is to decide slowly, and act rapidly. That is, allow people to show their real natures and intentions. This can take weeks or months. Do take simple precautions with new friends and contacts. If you decide a person is a psychopath, and you cannot explain their behavior otherwise, cut them off. Simply ask them to never contact you again, and delete their details.

**The book made me wonder if I am a psychopath**

This is also a common experience. You can be manipulative, charming, an excellent mimic, and yet social. I can't say you're //not// a psychopath. You might well be. Are you the center of the universe? If you feel you are, then you may well be Mallory.

**So we are all a little bit psychopath?**

In certain ways, yes. This is the problem with looking for traits and signs. It is //outcomes// that matter. Are you investing in other people, or taking from them? We strive towards one or other direction. It is a life-long and obsessive process. There is no solid middle ground, only incompetence and error. The model of psychopathy as a smooth gradient, with empaths at one end, and serial killers at the other, is bogus. It's like saying, "we are all partly male, and at the extreme end are the rapists."

**So we all carry psychopath genes?**

Yes, indeed. There is no chance that an individual carries //none// of the necessary genes. Genetics is not so simple. We share 50% of our DNA with a banana. We certainly all carry a lot of psychopath genes. Most of these genes, in most people, are not expressed. Or if they are, it is in harmless or positive ways.

**Do psychopaths have ethics?**

Ethics is one of those slippery terms. Easy to use, hard to define. I assume you mean, do psychopaths set themselves limits on who they hurt? Some psychopaths declare, "children are off limits." Yet others exploit children without remorse. The best analogy I have is that psychopaths have food taboos. They learn what is good to eat, and what is harmful or forbidden, at an early age. It tends to be about costs versus benefits. Preying on children or the aged is taboo when there is real risk of punishment. Hunting other psychopaths can be toxic, and usually a bad idea. Otherwise, food is food.

**Do psychopaths feel love?**

Do you feel love for your breakfast? Or would you describe it as "hunger?" It does seem psychopaths feel something for absent or abusive parents. It's not love though, it is more like another form of hunger.

**So what emotions do psychopaths feel?**

Psychopaths feel those emotions needed to be a successful predator. These are: hunger, obsession, euphoria, schadenfreude, fury, bloodlust, gluttony, satiation, and blocked. I explain this in [#emotions]. All other emotions are absent. A psychopath can imitate some from birth, and some by learning. Others like remorse they just don't show, maybe because they can't fake the physical signs.

**What jobs attract psychopaths?**

Psychopaths are flexible and creative when it comes to hunting. What they seek are people and their assets. This means any organization will attract psychopaths. It's rarely about the salary, nor bonuses, which are fodder. Rather, psychopaths seek the chance to take what isn't theirs. They like jobs that let them travel. Certainly, positions of power and influence. Anything in finance. Jobs with access to vulnerable people. Jobs that rotate around image and charisma.

**Should my firm hire some psychopaths?**

Only if you are in the business of stealing and lying. There is a persistent myth that psychopaths are powerful and effective. It's a lie. I've worked with several psychopaths, and hired more than one. They certainly liven the place up. They will always act in their own interests, even when it hurts their colleagues, or their firm. They are the ones who accept bribes, plot against their bosses, steal clients, falsify accounts, and so on.

**How can I be sure I don't hire psychopaths?**

Background checks, sad to say. I don't like it yet there seems little alternative.

**Are all politicians psychopaths?**

Not all, just many. The most successful politicians get elected on promises, that they fail to deliver. They are charismatic actors who fit the role the public expects. They divide their opposition and blame their own failures on others. They lack empathy, and never show remorse for hurting others. Often they steal large amounts of money, and abuse their positions in every way possible.
