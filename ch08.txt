+ Children of the Fight

In this text I've often talked of an "arms race" between social and anti-social behavior. In biology, arms races between predator and prey are a classic engine of evolution. Our own arms race started many millions of years ago. It has been a long fight between collaborators and cheats. For every deceit, there's a defense. For every defense, there's a new attack. In this chapter I'll explain how this competition has shaped us. I'll argue that it hasn't just left a few traces. Rather, it has shaped and defined us.

++ Not The Ants You Are Looking For

I've already described the spiders that live in ant colonies, imitating their hosts, while slowly eating them. It's not just a few spiders. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_mimicry Thousands of species] of spiders and [http://www.hindawi.com/journals/psyche/2013/264279/ other insects] mimic ants to some degree.
 
Ant mimics have evolved many different ways to hide among their hosts. They may look like ants, with narrow waists, dark coloring, and long antennae that vibrate like ant antennae. They may smell like ants, which use a chemical language to distinguish friends from foes. They may move and behave like ants. They may even sound like ants.

In their paper [http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0130541 "The Pied Piper: A Parasitic Beetleâ€™s Melodies Modulate Ant Behaviours,"] Di Guilio and his colleagues explain how the larvae of the Maculinea butterfly steal from ants. They can mimic the queen ant's voice, and so get care from workers.

More fascinating are the ant nest beetles called Paussus. These live their entire lives in the ant colony. The Paussus beetles have evolved to hack into the ants' chemical network. Their bodies bristle with small hairs that exude chemical signals. With these signals, Paussus talks the ants' pheromone language. Once inside the colony, the beetles move around as they like. They can eat adult ants and larvae, with no response from their prey.

Paussus does this from birth, and can even interact with the ant queen. How is this possible? It turns out that Paussus also does the Maculinea trick, using sounds to mimic the ants' language. Not just a single language either. The beetle can speak three different ant languages including that of the queen. By making the right sounds, Paussus lies to the ants, telling them "it's OK" even as it gobbles them up.

The ant colony is a rich bait for any would-be predator. It is safe, warm, and full of food. The ants have been battling an endless stream of invaders, since they diverged from the wasp family 130 million years ago. And yet ants are a successful species. The latest estimate of "how many ants are there?" adds up to about the same mass as humans.

Ant colonies are "eusocial." They divide up the work, and take care of each others' young. They live in large colonies of multiple generations. This eusocial lifestyle did not pop up one day. It has evolved gradually over hundreds of millions of years.

There are two forces that pushed and still push the evolution of ants towards eusocial behavior. One is the economics of flowering plants. This development created a world of seasonal bounties mixed with famine. Individual insects can only take small advantage of this. A colony can hoard during good times, so spread the risk, and flatten it out.

The second force is that horde of predators trying to get the benefits of the ants' work, without the investment. This drives the ants to become better organized to detect and attack intruders. They develop distinctive languages of chemicals and sounds. They recognize each other, form a caste system, and so on.

The evolution of social behavior in ants starts with risk sharing, and then turns into an arms race with cheats. It is fair to say that without the predators, ant society would not exist. Not only ants: termites, bees, and species of wasp have evolved along the same path.

Yet neither the ants nor their predators have any choice in the matter. It seems to be inevitable.

When there is an uneven food supply, species will evolve ways to spread the risk, or they will go extinct. They can migrate to follow food. They can adapt their metabolism over time. Or they can work in groups to cover a wider area, and share windfalls when they find them. Risk sharing turns out to be the most effective strategy.

Game theory predicts that when a group works together to spread risk, others will find ways to cheat. That is, to benefit from the work of the group without personal cost. Social insects eliminate cheats from within the colony by eliminating genetic competition. We still see colonies of the same ant species stealing from each other, in some cases. Most who cheat social insects comes from other species.

And when cheating strategies evolve, the social species will evolve defenses, or go extinct. The defenses against cheats always follow the same patterns: identify intruders and attack them. Identification can be visual, chemical, tactile, acoustic. And so social species evolve languages, identity, memory, and so on, to fight the cheats.

++ The Vampire Underground

Social behavior appears in non-insect species too. Let's travel 30 million years back to the Oligocene, a time when the tropical jungles of the Eocene began to give way to our present day Miocene period.

The world cooled, and the first permanent ice sheets formed over the continent of Antarctica. And the tropical jungles covering the globe shrank, and shrank, until there remained only a belt around the equator. These jungles were filled with life. It was a time of giant penguins, and ancestors of elephants, rhinos, camels, cows, and horses.

On these animals fed blood-sucking insects that burrowed through hair, hide, feathers, scales and skin. And to feed on these insects came the bats, far cousins of dolphins and whales. Some bats ate fruit, and some hunted small birds or reptiles. And some followed the rich carpet of blood-sucking insects, to specialize in parasite removal.

These bats landed on birds, reptiles, or mammals, and picked off the ticks and leeches. They grew to depend on rich red blood as the main part of their diet, and they evolved to land and feed without disturbing the larger citizens of the jungles they landed on.

Sooner or later, the bats slipped from removing blood suckers, to taking blood themselves. Their mouths evolved sharp teeth, to slice little holes without pain. Their tongues evolved into little straws that could sip delicately. And their hands evolved into grips that could hold tight, even if their host woke up and shook their body.

The vampire bats learned to share, as birds do, their food with their young. Feeding on insects is one thing. Digging holes into large animals is something else, not easy for the younger bats. Mothers shared with juveniles too young to hunt for themselves. Vampire bat families grew into large colonies dominated by females, mostly sisters and cousins, while males flitted around the outside.

As the technique of meal sharing spread, adult bats also learned to share with each other. They built an economy of mutual need. A vampire bat that can't feed for two or three nights will starve. A lucky bat can gorge itself, yet it cannot store fat. Extra weight is unacceptable for a flying animal. The best strategy for storing blood is to "lend" it to unlucky bats in the hope of getting it back in the future.

Sharing blood meals removes much of the risk of an unstable food supply. More generous bats would be surrounded by more relatives, and so increase their own chances of survival. The genes for sharing behavior spread and became dominant. Yet in every economy, some players will try to cheat. It is inevitable. So along with the selfish genes for altruism, came the selfish genes for fraud and trickery.

It doesn't take a huge genetic leap, simply some slowing of development. The adult bat looks and acts more juvenile. It's a trick we see in other species too, like humans and dogs. An adult dog that shows floppy ears and wagging tail will look like a big puppy, and disarm the competitive instinct in other dogs. A human that shows large round eyes and strong emotions looks like a big child, and provokes sympathy and care-giving from other humans.

And so as the mainstream of vampire bats developed a mutual sharing culture, a minority got better and better at cheating. The sharing bats fought back by evolving ways to detect and fight cheats.

When sharing blood, instead of doing the polite "I vomit, you swallow" thing, the sharing bats started to also groom each other, and chat with little bat squeaks. Vampire bat society is remarkably tight and cohesive. Bats keep track of their relatives, and more to the point, their relationships. It's the only way to detect cheats: retain a memory of transactions. The successful strategy is to start by sharing, and then to switch by denying, once a cheat is detected. Obvious cheats will be outcast, and rapidly die.

The cheaters didn't die out though. Instead, they got better at their own game. Cheating vampire bats don't simply come and beg for food. They start by talking, chattering, and faking the social grooming, without sharing food. Enough chatter and it starts to feel real. Over the years, cheaters got better and better at mimicry, able to fake voices and act injured, weak, vulnerable, young, innocent.

This slow, relentless arms race is a classic [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Queen_hypothesis Red Queen's Race] between a species and its parasites. This is a race where both parties run as fast as they can, simply to stay still. The conflict between honest and cheating vampire bats has run for millions of years, with neither side winning. Indeed, neither side can win. 

The species expresses two prime strategies, in genes and in culture, that have competed at equilibrium for millions of years. All vampire bats carry the genes, to some degree. And in a consistent, small percentage of cases, a bat is born with sufficient talent to become a cheat. It is an all-or-nothing strategy. One cannot be a part-time cheat, and succeed.

++ The Eusocial Apex

Vampire bats are part of the larger family of New World leaf nosed bats. It's notable how the vampire's fruit and insect eating cousins are much less social, roosting in small groups, while the vampire bats roost in colonies of up to a thousand bats. Looking at the ape family, and humans, we see much the same thing. Humans are hyper-social. We live in colonies of hundreds, thousands, millions. And like the vampire bats, we depend on a delicate economy of mutual sharing to survive risk.

In his 2012 book "The Social Conquest of the Earth," Edward Wilson described humans as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eusociality eusocial apes], where our divisions of labor, overlapping generations, and cooperative care of young give us a "superpower" that no other species can achieve.

The vision of humans as eusocial apes is elegant and fitting. I've discussed other social animals like ants. Yet these cannot scale as humans do. No matter what tribes we come from, we will work together. Whereas ants form a colony organism, loyal to a queen, humans form networks of relationships. Sometimes these are hierarchical. More often we form diverse relationships between individuals and groups. Those relationships aren't arbitrary. They are driven by meticulous accounting of credit and debt, of genes, food, shelter, sex, information, time, and so on.

The mental tools we have developed to track these relationships are sophisticated and practically define us as "human". We can remember faces for a lifetime. We can mentally balance the accounting for relationships with fifty to a hundred people. We can rapidly gauge the relative value of any favor or item, in a given place or time. That roast chicken you shared with me for lunch is worth three beers tomorrow, or one in two weeks' time. We remember cheats, forever, and we do not forgive them. We have imagination, so we can plan how to work together. We have language, to exchange knowledge. We have faces, to express our emotions. The list goes on and on and on.

Humans evolved all these genes during a period of severe climate shifts that hammered our environment over and over during the last million years. As we survived through near-extinction bottlenecks that made us all close cousins, we survived disaster after disaster by working together. Our society evolved from being dependent on nature, and based on individuals and small family groups, to being self-hosting through technology, and based on limitless eusociality and knowledge sharing.

And driving this evolution was the parallel evolution of cheater genes that developed talents for exploiting others and giving nothing in return.

++ The Forever War

When did human psychopathy start to evolve? It is a question no-one else has ever asked, according to Google. We can make a good guess at the answer. 

First, we can rule out a recent origin. Psychopathy is a consistent feature of humanity across the world. It is a human universal. It thus predates our expansion out of Africa, some 150,000 years ago.

The origins of humanity keep getting pushed back in time. The ritual burial cave of homo naledi in South Africa dates from around 3 million years ago. The oldest stone tools [http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/43066/title/Oldest-Stone-Tools-Discovered/ go back 3.3 million years].

Ritual burials speak of empathy for the dead, and social emotions that go beyond tribe and family. Stone tools point to a structured society with division of labor, some level of trade, and forward planning.

Let me explain that. To turn stone into usable tools takes long skill and learning. We know this, because the techniques follow a slow, incremental evolution. This means knowledge passed down the generations. This means specialized individuals, even a caste of tool makers. Tool makers are not hunters, since they would be too precious. So, that means trade.

As Scientific American [http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/archaeologists-take-wrong-turn-find-world-s-oldest-stone-tools-update/ writes,]

> The Lomekwi knappers were able to deliver sufficient intentional force to detach repeatedly series of adjacent and superposed flakes and then to continue knapping by rotating the cores. [They] intentionally selected big, heavy blocks of very hard raw material from nearby sources even though smaller blocks were available. They used various knapping techniques to remove the sharp-edged flakes from the cores.

The raw materials are not widespread. This means toolmakers must travel to places where they can find the right rocks. They must make their tools. They must carry those tools back to people who need to use them. This means taking food and water, sacks or ropes, and so on.

It also means the ability to plan in advance and organize socially. This sounds advanced for hominids with small brains, until you realize that ants do much the same. This behavior does not need to be conscious. It can be instinctive.

A stone tool production chain, with cores, flakes, and anvils goes beyond the mental capacity of a single individual. It tells us there was a social structure. Some specialized in making tools. Others specialized in using the tools for hunting, cleaning meat, breaking bones, cutting wood, or whatever. Such a social structure means collaboration between individuals. And whenever there is collaboration, there are cheats.

So we can date human psychopathy to at least 3 million years ago. For sure, it has evolved continuously since then, as has human social behavior.

Can we date it further back? 

Our cousin species chimpanzees show many of the same emotions as humans. They show the predator, defense, and sexual emotions. They show the family and tribal emotions to some extent. Their displays may be different, yet the emotions behind them are the same.

It is the social emotions that are uniquely human. So we can postulate that our last common ancestor, 13 million years ago, already had tribal emotions.

Human social emotions thus evolved at some stage between 13 and 3 millions years ago. My hypothesis is that psychopathy co-evolved with these emotions. The social emotions are in fact a language, like the ants' languages, evolved to detect cheats.

++ The Predator Model

By luck, or perhaps from personal experience, Bram Stoker drew a remarkably accurate picture of the psychopath as predator. The story is not meant to be taken literally. It's a metaphor, and a good one. Vampires come in the night, dressed to kill, and slowly suck the life out of you, even as they seduce you with their charm and sexuality.

Vampires do not kill outright. Rather, they turn you into weak copies of themselves. They are powerful and animalistic and they can read your thoughts, even as you frantically try to escape. And the best tension is human versus vampire, with vampire-on-vampire conflict as cherry topping. As for the garlic, and crucifixes, and stakes through the heart, I guess Bram was being wishful here.

Dr Robert Hare started describing psychopaths as social predators in [https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/199401/charming-psychopath his 1994 article in Psychology Today], "This Charming Psychopath -- How to spot social predators before they attack." In this article and most of his work, he focused on identifying psychopaths, designing his famous "Psychopath Checklist."

In 2014, [http://www.chinastrategies.com/ Stefan H. Verstappen], in his booklet [http://www.chinastrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/defenseagainstpsychopath.pdf Defense Against The Psychopath], took the predator analogy further, and suggested that psychopaths are using a "cheating strategy."

Daniel N. Jones, of the University of Texas at El Paso, and principal investigator at the Dark-Triad and Corporate Crime Laboratory, [http://aeon.co/magazine/science/animal-deception-illuminates-the-human-variety/ wrote more on the cheating strategy:]

> Some predators are fast, mobile and wide-ranging, executing their deceptions on as many others as they can; they resemble human psychopaths. Others are slow, stalking their prey in a specific, strategic (almost Machiavellian) way... There is a never-ending arms race between the deceiver and the deceived among most living things.

Predators deceive their prey as a core strategy. Human predators cheat their victims as a core strategy. It is the same thing. Animal models are essential to understanding and predicting human behavior, mainly because we're so slow to look at ourselves honestly. Our self-analysis is polluted by magical theories like "free will" and "consciousness" which can neither be improved, nor disproved. However we have no trouble dissecting animal behavior without such distractions.

What I've done in this book is take the predator model as a backbone onto which all the rest can hang. We start with predators that cheat their way through the human social universe, and all the rest can be derived from that. Everything we know about psychopaths, from the charm to the brutality to the lies, makes sense in the predator/cheat model.

As with all good models, we can also use the predator model to predict and to explore further. One rich area that [https://www.google.be/search?q=psychopath+arms+race no-one else seems to have explored yet], is that arms race between predator and prey.

The Wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation article on predation] says:

> The relationship between predator and prey is typically beneficial to the predator, and detrimental to the prey species. Sometimes, however, predation has indirect benefits to the prey species, though the individuals preyed upon themselves do not benefit. This means that predator and prey species are in an evolutionary arms race to maximize their respective abilities to obtain food or avoid being eaten. This interaction has resulted in a vast array of adaptations in both groups.

Dr Hare has been refining his checklist for more than 20 years. It is not a moving target: he has been telling us quite clearly, "psychopaths are highly predictable and similar in profound ways."

Predators do obviously have to learn and practice. Twin studies show that psychopathy is highly heritable, yet not inevitable even in those who have all the right genes. Circumstance switches on the appropriate genes and pushes the individual to specialize.

++ The Secret Languages of Empathy

I like the model in which human social behavior and psychopathy co-evolved. On the one hand we evolved a brain capable of building social networks with hundreds of others. And on the other hand, we evolved the talents to cheat and lie our way through these networks.

We assume brain size defines intelligence, in some fuzzy sense. We humans define ourselves by our big brains more than anything else. What drove the expansion of the human brain over the last millions of years? The [http://www.livescience.com/5540-human-brains-big.html answer turns out] to be other people. As David Geary says:

> There was very little change in brain size across our sample of fossil skulls until we hit a certain population size. Once that population density was hit, there was a very quick increase in brain size.

Geary suggests that "social competition" is behind the growth. More individuals competing for the same food means smarter individuals will survive, and have more offspring. Less smart ones will reproduce less.

This explanation fails for several reasons. We know that human food supply, except in catastrophic conditions, is a factor of population. Food is not a static resource, waiting to be harvested and consumed. It is a deep and complex puzzle, solved by technology, knowledge, collaboration, and trading. The more people, the more food. Our collaborative model gets more, not less, effective with more people. At least, until we exhaust the environment or there is serious climate change.

Secondly, there is no mechanism why intelligence should result in more babies. It does not happen in other animals. Big brains are expensive. Why not evolve larger teeth, or stronger muscles, or spiky tails? It seems rather arbitrary to claim intelligence as the key to survival.

There is one model that does work, though. That is the arms race between collaborators and cheats. When populations are thin, cheating is self-defeating. The cheat needs a minimum population density so they can move on, after exhausting a particular territory.

So the scope and incentive for psychopaths increased as ancient human populations grew. At a certain point, the arms race turned hot. We evolved social emotions to detect and punish cheats. We evolved manipulation and emotional mimicry to hack the emotional languages. Our emotions became more complex. Our mimicry got better. We developed better social memories. We learned how to become better liars.

And so on and on. Our brains are stuffed full with psychopathic talents, and psychopath detectors. It's not that the more intelligent humans had more babies. The arms race did a pincer movement on small brains. We are either superb collaborators, or we are superb cheats. Both take a lot of brain power: the more, the better. There is no middle ground.

Let's recap the social emotions. Each of these is an adaptation to defend against various psychopathic talents:

* //Like// and //dislike// - the emotions of social accounting. They seem simple, yet these emotions are the output of long and complex calculations. The calculations take into account years of observations, transactions, and received knowledge. This translates into a simple "yes/no/maybe" value we feel and show as pleasure or distrust. It drives us to avoid cheats, and invest more in honest players. Psychopaths cheat this by beaming love or dislike at their targets.

* //Anxiety// - the emotion of preparing for a threat. This is the emotion that says something bad is happening, and asks others for help. Again, it can be a simple result of a complex calculation. Some anxiety is obvious: tomorrow I must meet important people, and that stresses me. Most anxiety is a vague "something is not right" gut feeling, that will not go away. I believe it's often caused by one or more subconscious psychopath detectors shrieking at us.

* //Guilt// - the emotion of breaking a social code. This is the emotion that says, "I am not a psychopath, promise!" when we are caught cheating. Everyone breaks rules at some point. Social groups need a way to distinguish casual criminals, who can reform, from professionals, who cannot. It is this: casual criminals can feel and display guilt. Psychopaths have evolved good imitations of guilt. Yet they are not perfect, and we can often tell the difference.

* //Shame// - the emotion of humiliation. This emotion says, "I'm aware that I broke the rules." Again, this is about detecting professional rule breakers. Shame has a specific skin flushing pattern: face and ears. Psychopaths can mimic the body language, yet they do not blush or show red ears, and cannot fake this. Shame is such a powerful psychopath filter that social humans also mimic it, by blushing in socially awkward situations. 

* //Remorse// - the emotion of apology. Remorse is how we say "sorry" and ask others to forgive us. Remorse has a body language, yet the key to an authentic display is timing and duration. You must say "sorry" at the right time, and for the right amount. To do this requires empathy for //dislike// and //righteousness//.

* //Impatience// - the emotion of telling someone to hurry up. Impatience is what we feel when someone is violating our planning. The social response to impatience is remorse, with an apology. Like remorse, this takes empathy to get right. The human obsession with time keeping and schedules seems bizarre until you see it as a psychopath detector.

* //Amusement// - the emotion of a sudden understanding. Our sense of humor is another of those "why did we evolve it?" puzzles. Until you realize it's a psychopath test, and then it's clear. One must laugh at the right time, in the right way, and for the right duration. To do this takes empathy for the subject of the joke.

* //Righteousness// - the emotion of punishing a rule breaker. This is the emotion that pushes us to actually confront and expel psychopaths. Whether due to infidelity, theft, deception, or other violations, it is indignation and righteousness that propel us out of Mallory's hands.

++ Crime and Punishment

Rules are such an important defense against psychopaths that crime and punishment have four distinct emotions. Laws are a human universal. The details vary by culture. In some, murder is a capital offense. In others, it is a rite of passage. In some, property is sacred. In others, it is theft. And so on. What is consistent is that laws are passed down from generation to generation, and enforced by force.

It could be a tribal council expelling a persistent offender, a court sentencing a convicted criminal, or a judge ruling on a copyright violation. We live by laws that are handed down through the centuries. We refine these laws continuously, and we enforce them with all the power of the State.

Many people have wondered why we tolerate the State. After all, it is costly and often gets in our way. It is true that governments often become self-driving bureaucracies. Others become murderous dictatorships. Others become cynical patriarchies. Yet the overriding tendency, throughout history, is towards peace and stability.

The evolution of the State is like the ants' evolution of a colony caste system and a queen. It is constraining, and can go awry, yet it is better than the alternatives. When I walk down the street, and see police, my first reaction is mild distaste. Yet when someone steals my backpack with all my stuff in it, I run into the street searching for a uniform.

Social humans do not need the State, in my experience. I've studied group behavior for a long time. Most people sincerely want to work together. The actual proportion of good actors varies. In some contexts it's above 99%. In others, it may barely hit 50%. No matter: good actors aim one way, and bad actors the other. As I said, we're born to be either superb collaborators or superb cheats.

So good actors are obsessively looking for ways to behave better. They ask others, "how am I doing?" and they adjust their behavior. It does not take rules. Nor does it take learning. It is an instinctive behavior that runs off empathy.

Yet the bad actors are always searching for new ways to abuse others. They ask, "where are the boundaries?" and then they find ways to break them. Again, it takes no learning. It is instinctive behavior that runs off hunger and ennui.

What the healthy State does is to build a defense consisting of thousands upon thousands of rules. In some senses, the more the better. These rules must be self-consistent and pragmatic. And then the State enforces the rules, and by doing so, it catches cheats and gradually excludes them.

As observers, we're fast to see the mistakes and flaws, and slow to see the successes. Yet over time, it works. Violence and crime fall, globally, year on year. And the State is homing in on the damage that individual psychopaths do. Domestic violence is not tolerated in most developed countries, where it used to be. And the old model of domestic violence as a gender issue (where only women are victims and only men are perpetrators) is breaking.

Schools are becoming more aware of their minority of psychopathic students. I don't think they have the right tools to identify them. Nor do I feel that hunting down juvenile psychopaths is a remotely sane idea. Yet these are separate issues. The emerging understanding that 4% of humans are designed to make trouble is a good start.

++ That's the Joke

I've often wondered where we humans got our sense of humor. It serves no apparent evolutionary purpose. I do not like the answer, "not everything in our nature has to have an evolutionary reason." That is like saying, "the reason birds can fly is that not every object has to obey the laws of physics". Yes, everything in our nature must have, and does have, an evolutionary reason, and searching for this can enlighten. So it is with humor.

Humor is built in, a human universal, visible in children from a young age. Babies giggle with joy when they play with their parents. We instinctively trust people who can make us laugh, and distrust those who don't like our jokes, or seem to lack a sense of humor. We use humor more in stressful situations. We value original humor and reward the "telling" more than the joke itself. In our horror films, the monsters don't ever laugh, except in that terrible creepy way that scares young children. Monsters certainly don't make puns, let alone tell fart jokes.

A joke is a funny thing. Every joke, even puns, depends on a mystery. We don't tell the mystery. That would be "explaining the joke". Rather, we tell the joke and then we wait for the other person to "get it". When they get it, they laugh, and we laugh, and the ritual handshake is complete. It's not enough to simply laugh, either. Both parties must laugh at the right moment, not too soon, not too late. The laugh must last long enough. It must not be too loud, nor too soft. Such a precise thing, the humor protocol! Tell me again this is not carefully engineered.

There's a man I know well who cannot laugh properly. He laughs well, the right volume, and at the right time, yet he will laugh too long, so you imagine he is being deliberately mocking. Except he sincerely does not know how much he should laugh. He gets the joke, yet not its proportions. He laughs wrong. And he has does not tell jokes.

What is going on here? I believe that humor is in fact an empathy detector. Psychopaths don't have empathy, for the same reason that fish don't have feathers. Empathy is a eusocial mechanism. It is a tool in our brain, seated in the supramarginal gyrus (as far as I know), which guesses and measures how much other people appreciate us. When someone around us is unhappy, we feel unhappy. When someone around us is angry, we feel afraid. When someone around us is happy and laughing, we feel happy and want to laugh too.

The point of empathy is that as eusocials, we need this feedback to know how well we're doing in building the relationships we depend on for survival. Whereas, a psychopath measures success differently, and having empathy and feelings would cripple their game.

Every joke has a hidden story that we can only read if we're empathetic with the teller. Lacking empathy, psychopaths cannot decode the mystery, and so cannot laugh properly. Thus psychopaths either do not laugh, or they laugh too much, or they laugh too long. So psychopaths prefer opening situations where humor isn't an option, like noisy nightclubs, business functions, and electronic messages.

Humor doesn't work perfectly, none of our psychopath detectors do. You won't a laugh from someone who's filled with self-pity or jealousy, no matter how well you tell the joke. There are a whole range of reasons our sense of humor can be switched off temporarily, or even permanently for innocent reasons. Particularly, victims of abuse will not laugh much. Not laughing is not a red flag.

And psychopaths do blend in like the professional con artists they are. When they notice people laughing, and realize someone has told a joke, they may simply keep smiling, laughing gently, as if the entire situation was comedic. This can work. However, we tend to treat those who laugh too much with even more suspicion than those who don't laugh at all.

++ The History of Art

So while we prefer people who laugh "naturally," and blush "innocently," if we are too harsh in filtering out potential friends, partners, or colleagues, we end up alone. Thus we have a myriad of other subtle tools for detecting psychopaths behind their masks. One that is most interesting to me, because it practically defines "being human" is a clear extension of our sense of humor, a more sophisticated language of empathy. That is, art.

By "art" I mean the creation of works that serve no functional purpose except to cause an emotional response in the audience. As with comedy, we reward originality more than technical brilliance. As with comedy, we enjoy art more in company than alone. And as with comedians, we praise and respect artists, though artistic talent has zero obvious survival value. Finally, we measure artists by their track record: one success isn't enough. That could be faked, stolen, or accidental. Whereas for scientists or athletes, one victory can last a lifetime.

Artistic talent is so widespread that it plays on every street corner for pennies. Yet we respect it deeply. Above all, we expect art to make us "feel" something. And we ask this of others: "how does it make you feel?," and we watch their faces intently as they answer. Isn't this kind of weird?

Some evolutionary psychologists have argued that humans use art like some extravagant nest building birds do. That is, a display of talent that serves to show, "I am strong enough to afford this waste of time." Like the peacock's tail, it shows the excess resources of the artist. It does indeed take great investments of time and effort to make successful creative works.

However, unlike the nests of the bower birds, or the peacock's tail, we do not create art as part of a mating ritual. Rather, we create as a public statement: "this is me, look upon my works!" It is not peacocking, if there's no ritual sex for the winners. And the best artists are not fat and happy and strong. They are starving, desperate, and filled with trauma and pain. A large, expensive car is peacocking. A series of weird paintings is not.

And here is one thing about psychopaths: they do not engage in artistic creation. They do not draw, paint, sculpt or carve. They do not take photographs, except of themselves and their possessions. They do not cook for pleasure, invent recipes, or make their own bread as a hobby. They do not create music, though they can be excellent performers of others' work. It is a curious thing, when you first see it, and it matches the psychopath's general lack of a sense of humor.

There is a whole class of activities we call "hobbies," that we engage in passionately and yet which have, again, no obvious survival value. I cannot believe that "relaxing after work" counts, as there were no 9-to-5 jobs in prehistory. Yet look at how people describe their hobbies, and you see three kinds. There are the "working with or for others on unpaid activities" hobbies that most people do. There are the collection hobbies some people focus on, perhaps to satisfy their need for control over a chaotic world. And then there are the vacuous pseudo-hobbies that psychopaths engage in: traveling, eating out, meeting new people, shopping.

Creativity is another secret language of empathy. It tells the world, "friend or foe? Look at this and tell me you feel something!," and the viewer responds, or fails the test. It is precisely like telling a joke. Like a great joke, a great creative work must speak from and to the supramarginal gyrus, telling half a story that only a eusocial can complete and "get".

A young child learns to draw at school, and takes their works back to their parents. These gifts are not materially useful, and yet they are highly important. The child watches their parent's reaction, and when they see joy at the squished faces and strange colors, the child also feels joy. They share the moment, confirming each others' eusocial humanity. "See, mommy, I'm normal. Please don't reject me!"

We create for others. We create to make other people feel something. Usually, it's happiness, though sometimes it's loss, sadness, or other emotions. A creative act is a message of empathy. And we measure the quality of our art as we do our humor: by its originality, and thus its authenticity.

Which is why imitative art is "fake," why engineering isn't art, why fast food feel "cheap," why we don't explain jokes, and why an artist cannot explain the "point" of his or her work. It is a test, and if you don't know the answer, that itself is significant. It's why a pile of bricks in the Tate Gallery is worth a million pounds. That's the joke.

Psychopaths may buy or steal art, and may learn to cook and paint. They may collect others' work on a huge scale. They may learn the language of art appreciation, and demonstrate their love of art with extravagance that can be monumental. They like to buy expensive clothes. They enjoy movies that explain how people work, and they despise horror movies because they see caricatures of their own world view. This is perhaps why young people enjoy taking their dates to such films.

++ The Lead Stinger

During the competition between the two faces of human nature, the psychopath genes didn't wait idly to be selected out of the gene pool. Rather, they did what genes do, when faced with pressure: they explored for opportunities for profit, and when they found such spaces, they expanded into them. This includes vulnerable points in the creative process. Such as, the delivery of art to an audience.

At some point, art needs a presenter, and here the psychopath gains a pedestal. That talent for emotional imagination and projection lets a psychopath take art and turn it into an "experience" that is much easier to digest.

Most people are a bit narcissistic. Indeed, most of us are a bit psychopathic. What matters is the degree. The psychopath does not switch it off, and spends a life in pursuit of self, living a fantasy VIP world, filled with casual sex, drug use, and random opportunistic crime.

If you know the music business at all, you'll recognize the psychopaths. They are the lead singers, the Faces. They're the ones who get their name on the cover and poster. They borrow from everyone and do not pay back. They use people like toys, to play with, break, and discard.

Creating live, improvised music is an interesting experience, and another of those psychopath filters. It is hard to improvise when you //know// you are superior to the people around you. Improvising requires letting go of your ego, something psychopaths cannot do, except by force. Psychopaths can be technically excellent musicians, yet they will not join a jam session unless they can dominate.

There are countless examples of musicians who are clearly psychopaths. These are the "one hit wonders," who get a single album or hit, thanks to work done by unseen producers and writers, and then fade into history. A psychopath cannot hold a group together, does not write their own songs, cannot work well with others. They typically move from gig to gig, borrowing money and favors as they go, until they have nowhere left to hunt.

The extreme histrionic behavior shown by many performers doesn't look, at first sight, like psychopathic behavior. After all, giving a good show doesn't do any harm. However being able to bend an entire event to one's personal benefit is a psychopathic trait. So I think histrionic talent is probably a more recent development in the psychopathic gene consortium, evolved as a way to turn art back to its benefit.

++ Conclusions

In this article I've stated the hypothesis that bad actors are an essential friction for good ones. That human culture and society, language and the large brain are driven by the need to share knowledge and resources, and work together. And that these are the result of a million year arms' race with the cheaters we call "psychopaths" (or narcissist, Machiavellian, sociopath).

This theory, which I'll brand the "Two Actors Hypothesis," has some interesting correlations that let us speculate on the nature of intelligence. Humanity is not the only social species. My friend Wesley remarked, when I explained this theory to him, that Orcas (killer whales) are also highly social and have large brains. We've seen the vampire bat story. There are other social animals too: mole rats, dolphins, dogs and wolves, gorillas, ants, bees, wasps, and termites.

The Two Actors Hypothesis should be easy to disprove. We find a social species that has no bad actors, and where social behavior cannot be cleanly explained in terms of filters and weapons against bad actors.

Social species show different levels of sociality. What they have in common is the strategy of risk sharing though other individuals of the same family or species. It is clear that sociality is a repeating pattern for risk sharing. Indeed, you could argue that it is inevitable that social behavior will emerge over and over, in the spectrum of life. And together with sociality, will come cheating. It is inevitable. Even ants have [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/01/090109-cheating-ants.html their bad actors].

And bad actors provide the friction that forces sociality towards ever an more sophisticated culture. Humans have music and fancy food, and ants have pheromones. The arms race is inevitable. It may run slowly as in insects with limited capacity for added software, or it may run rapidly, as it has in mammals.

Mammal sociality is software based, so to speak, and social mammals like orcas and humans have developed larger and larger brains, driven by the needs of sociality. If it's good to remember five faces, it's better to remember five thousand. If one psychopath filter is good, a hundred are better. Thus human intelligence, like that of the toothed whales, is driven by that ancient arms race between the good and the bad actor algorithms.

Psychopaths are not sick or broken people. I do consider them to cause mental illness in others, in the form of depression, PTSD, and suicidal urges. I respect all life, and every actor is essentially innocent. However my goal with this hypothesis is to provide strategies for dealing more effectively with bad actors, before, during, and after that vampire's embrace.

Animal models also hold out hope for long term social integration of psychopaths, by providing them with environments that satisfy their hunting urges without allowing them to hurt others. If that sounds far-fetched, consider complex and sometimes violent multi-player video games, and their appeal to psychopaths. In games like EVE Online, there are [http://www.theverge.com/2014/1/29/5356498/eve-online-battle-sees-200000-dollars-worth-of-spaceships-destroyed massive conspiracies, deceits, raids, and battles] that end in hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of damage.
