There are some scary people around. People who hurt others casually, and without remorse. These predators take what they want, using charm, wits, and a lack of any empathy. We call them psychopaths, sociopaths, malignant narcissists, or trolls. Are they mentally ill, or are they a sub-species of human? How can we identify them, and how can we stop them doing so much damage? Based on years of field research, this book cracks the psychopath code, and gives answers.
