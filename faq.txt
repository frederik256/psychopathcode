++ Politics

**Are all politicians psychopaths?**

Not all, just many. The most successful politicians get elected on promises, that they fail to deliver. They are charismatic actors who fit the role the public expects. They divide their opposition and blame their own failures on others. They lack empathy, and never show remorse for hurting others. Often they steal large amounts of money, and abuse their positions in every way possible.

++ Business

**Should my firm hire some psychopaths?**

Only if you are in the business of stealing and lying. There is a persistent myth that psychopaths are powerful and effective. It's a myth. I've worked with several psychopaths, and hired more than one. They certainly liven the place up. They will always act in their own interests, even when it hurts their colleagues, or their firm. They are the ones who accept bribes, plot against their bosses, steal clients, falsify accounts, and so on.

++ General

**Aren't we all a little bit psychopath?**

Some people see psychopathy as a gradient that we all sit on. At the extreme end are the real psychopaths, namely serial killers. The rest of us are spread out like peanut butter, each with more or less of the traits. It is a model that is neither accurate nor helpful. It is like saying, "we are all a little bit male, and at the extreme end are the rapists." All women carry male genes, all men carry female genes. Yet gender is a dichotomy. To be a successful male, you need a set of traits and talents. To be a successful female, you need another set. These two sets overlap hugely yet it is the differences that are significant. During development, each individual strives to join one set, or the other. Gender is not a gradient. It is the same with psychopathy vs. social behavior.

**So we all carry psychopath genes?**

Yes, indeed. There is no chance that an individual carries //none// of the necessary genes. Genetics is not simple. We share 40% of our genes with a stick of celery.

**Do psychopaths have ethics?**

Ethics is one of those slippery terms. Easy to use, hard to define. I assume you mean, do psychopaths set themselves limits on who they hurt? Some psychopaths declare, "children are off limits." Yet others exploit children without remorse. The best analogy I have is that psychopaths have food taboos. They learn what is good to eat, and what is harmful or forbidden, at an early age. It tends to be about costs versus benefits. Preying on children or the aged is taboo when there is real risk of punishment. Hunting other psychopaths can be toxic, and usually a bad idea. Otherwise, food is food.

**Do psychopaths feel love?**

Do you feel love for your breakfast? Or would you describe it as "hunger?"

**So what emotions do psychopaths feel?**

Psychopaths feel those emotions needed to be a successful predator. These are: hunger, obsession, euphoria, schadenfreude, fury, bloodlust, gluttony, satiation, and blocked. I explain this in [#emotions]. All other emotions are absent. A psychopath can imitate some from birth, and some by learning. Others they just don't show.

**Is there a single accurate psychopath test?**

Yes. It is neither quick nor simple. You observe a person for some time. If they break a rule you watch their behavior. You look for guilt before someone catches them. You look for shame and remorse after someone catches them. If they show none of these, they may be a psychopath. If they show all these, they most likely are not. To be sure you must observe several instances of rule breaking, in different contexts. If the psychopath knows you're watching, it may not work.
