++ Politics

**Are all politicians psychopaths?**

Not all, just many. The most successful politicians get elected on promises, that they fail to deliver. They are charismatic actors who fit the role the public expects. They divide their opposition and blame their own failures on others. They lack empathy, and never show remorse for hurting others. Often they steal large amounts of money, and abuse their positions in every way possible.

**Should my firm hire some psychopaths?**

Only if you are in the business of stealing and lying. There is a persistent myth that psychopaths are powerful and effective. It's a myth. I've worked with several psychopaths, and hired more than one. They certainly liven the place up. They will always act in their own interests, even when it hurts their colleagues, or their firm. They are the ones who accept bribes, plot against their bosses, steal clients, falsify accounts, and so on.

**Aren't we all a little bit psychopath?**

Some people see psychopathy as a gradient that we all sit on. At the extreme end are the real psychopaths, namely serial killers. The rest of us are spread out like peanut butter, each with more or less of the traits. It is a model that is neither accurate nor helpful. It is like saying, "we are all a little bit male, and at the extreme end are the rapists." All women carry male genes, all men carry female genes. Yet gender is a dichotomy. To be a successful male, you need a set of traits and talents. To be a successful female, you need another set. These two sets overlap hugely yet it is the differences that are significant. During development, each individual strives to join one set, or the other. Gender is not a gradient. It is the same with psychopathy vs. social behavior.
